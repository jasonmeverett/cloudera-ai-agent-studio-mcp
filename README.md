# Cloudera AI Agent Studio MCP Server

Agent Studio MCP Server is a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridge that exposes your Agent Studio instance as a set of callable tools.
It lets Claude (or any other MCP-aware client) list, inspect, and build Agent Studio workflows on the fly.

## âœ¨ What it can do

| Tool | Description | Typical Usage |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `list_current_workflows()` | Returns every workflowâ€™s **ID** and **name** | Populate a UI drop-down of existing projects |
| `get_workflow_information(id)` | Fetch full JSON metadata for one workflow | Inspect tasks, agents, and process settings |
| `create_workflow(name, description)` | Spin up a brand-new blank workflow | Automate project scaffolding |
| `make_workflow_conversational(workflow_id)` | Adds a *Conversational Task* and flips `is_conversational` to `true` | Turn a static workflow into a chat-first experience |
| `add_manager_agent_to_workflow(workflow_id, â€¦)` | Creates a **manager agent** and wires it in as the workflowâ€™s supervisor | Hierarchical / delegated workflows |
| `add_agent_to_workflow(workflow_id, â€¦)` | Adds any number of additional agents to a workflow | Expand the crew with domain specialists |
